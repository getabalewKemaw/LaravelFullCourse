### error handling in laravel

-> eror  handling means not only cacthing errors
but it is 
-> keep the  importanmt user infos secure and safe from any kind of attack s -> that means when logs the erris it shodl not outpuit the impotant info about the user or the app


It’s about:

Keeping your app secure (not leaking internal info to clients),

Keeping logs clean and useful for debugging,

Providing clear, consistent JSON responses for frontend developers or mobile apps,

And sometimes, reporting exceptions to external monitoring tools like Sentry, Flare, or Bugsnag.

-> method 1 in real apps 
1 sent the errors to the the sentry or email the dev team

2-develop  custom global exeception handler instaed of throwing errors here and there 


and the 404 notfound errors are not recognized to erros so we  need to craete a view for them so they are not recognized as errors b/c that is not errors
  do we  use the do not report functions


-> the next  bets thing is  adding the context to the errots so we can understand them easilly
and fix those easily


 do  when we do these we use the conetxt function with the arrow fucntions exmaples

 $e->context(['user' => $request->user()]); // add the current user to the exception context


-> the next best practices is adding custom http status codes to the websitess


->  the nesxt thig that is  helpful is using the exeception throttling (rate limmitign is used for the loginng of the  errors so we can limit how many times they can try to login  so the porpose of these is  to prevent brute force attacks on our website)

 and also limiting how many time the execeptiuonare logged


 use Illuminate\Support\Lottery;

->withExceptions(function ($exceptions) {
    $exceptions->throttle(function ($e) {
        return Lottery::odds(1, 1000); // log only 1 in every 1000 identical errors
    });
});


the final  best things are the ff
| Concept                 | Real-World Purpose                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **APP_DEBUG**           | Controls visibility of error details |
| **Reporting**           | Log or send to monitoring tools      |
| **Rendering**           | Control how the user/API sees errors |
| **Custom Exceptions**   | Create meaningful error types        |
| **Ignoring Exceptions** | Reduce log noise                     |
| **Context**             | Add useful metadata to logs          |
| **Throttling**          | Prevent flooding your logs           |
| **abort() helper**      | Manually throw HTTP error codes      |
| **Custom Pages / JSON** | Professional UX / API behavior       |


-> logging the errors is very important because if you dont log the errors then you will never know what is going wrong with your applicationng in laravel
-> that means showing what is going eron with the appications so we can fix it s bugs fastly and easily  and simply udnerstasn what is going on 
it is the backbone of the backend development

the laravel config is undr the config directoy and inside the loggig.php fiels



LOG_CHANNEL: defines where logs go (e.g. file, Slack, system, etc.)

LOG_LEVEL: defines the minimum importance level you want to log.




🧩 2. Channel Drivers (Ways to Store Logs)

Think of channels like “destinations” for logs.

Channel	Real-World Use
single	Writes to one file (local dev)
daily	Creates a new log file every day (production)
slack	Sends critical errors to your team’s Slack channel
papertrail	Sends logs to external log servers (like cloud monitoring)
syslog/errorlog	Sends logs to server’s system logs
stack	Combines multiple channels together (e.g., file + Slack)




### what to log in  logging?
-> there are mainly three types of porposes that we need to loggign

1 System events (like database connecti)ions migrations 

2 ,user action like login  logout  and the  like things

3 ,the third is  for handling eror and  execxeption s- to make the errors mored readable and understandble we are using the context function to add some extra information to the errors so we can understand them better and fix them faster
